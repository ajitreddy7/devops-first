GIT --> VCS(Version control system): used to store the source code of your project.
GITHUB: It is a service used to host the repository. 
Remote Repository --> Project Folder in any repository hosting service
Local Repository --> Project local folder
Working directory --> working folder
Staging area --> place to add required files and then commit them



WORKING DIRECTORY   |   STAGING AREA        |          LOCAL REPOSITORY   |    REMOTE REPOSITORY 

FILE.py        git add                  git commit		      git push
example.txt   -------->  example.txt  ------------->	example.txt  ----------->example.txt
example2.txt		 example2.txt			example2.txt		 example2.txt
             we can add               it commit all the		     this will push
	     only required            files.			     all the files.
  	     files using 
		add.

commands:
git init --> used to initialize a folder as git repository.

git status --> it will give the state of working directory and staging area

git add file_name.py  --> this will move the required file into staging area to commit into local repository

git add .  --> this will move all the untracked files into staging area.

git commit -m "message" --> locking them into history

git push origin development --> this will push the local development branch into repo

git push --all origin  --> this will push all the branches into remote repo

git branch  --> to check the current branch

git branch -a  --> lists all the branches in the local

git branch -r --> list all the local and remote branches

git branch development  --> create a new branch development

git switch development  --> switches into development branch

git branch -d branch-name  --> deletes the branch from the local repo

git merge development  --> merges into the current branch

git diff branch1..branch2  --> shows the difference between the branches

git clone <https link>   --> clones the repository from the remote into the local

git pull  --> pull the changes from remote branch which is linked to local branch

git pull --all  --> pull all the branches from the remote

git pull branch-name --> the changes from the mentioned branch into current branch.



GITHUB ACTIONS FOR CI/CD:

When ever a developer pushes the code into GitHub, this will trigger a workflow, which has particular steps to test your code.

FIRST you have to create this path in GitHub repository: .GitHub/workflows/name.yml
You will write the required checks in .yml file which will run based on event triggers

KEYTERMS:
Workflow: a series of jobs that runs together
Jobs: a groups of steps that run together
Step: a single task, like checking the code or running tests
Runner: The computer/server that runs your job
Trigger: decides when work flow runs
Environment variables: settings for workflow
Secrets: Password or API keys
